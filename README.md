## Problem Statement
Lending Club is a consumer finance marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.

It specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant's profile.

Like most other lending companies, *lending loans to ‘risky’* applicants is the largest source of financial loss *(called credit loss)*. The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.

In other words, **borrowers** who **default** cause the largest amount of **loss to the lenders**. In this case, the customers labelled as *'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'*.

The core objective of the excercise is to **help the company minimise the credit loss**. There are two potential sources of **credit loss** are:
* Applicant **likely to repay the loan**, such an applicant will bring in profit to the company with interest rates.** Rejecting such applicants will result in loss of business**.
 * Applicant **not likely to repay** the loan, i.e. and will potentially default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss* for the company

## Objectives
The goal is to *identify these risky loan applicants*, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA using the given [dataset](./data/loan.csv), is the aim of this case study.

If one is able to *identify these risky loan applicants*, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

In other words, **the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)** behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
